# Contributing to CCF

We welcome contributions! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving docs, or sharing what you built — there's a place for you.

## How to Contribute

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (`cargo test`)
5. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of what you changed and why

## Contributor License Agreement

By submitting a pull request or other contribution to this project, you agree to grant Colm Byrne / Flout Labs a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright and patent license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, and distribute your contributions. You further agree that Flout Labs may re-license these contributions under commercial terms as part of the CCF commercial licensing program.

This CLA exists because CCF is dual-licensed (BSL 1.1 for community use, commercial license for shipped products). Without it, contributions would create licensing ambiguity that prevents commercial deployment — which is the path to making this project sustainable.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the No Bad Stuff Manifesto in the README. We build for joy. Be kind, be curious, be constructive.
