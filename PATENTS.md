# Patent Notice: Contextual Coherence Fields (CCF)

The underlying methods implemented in this repository—specifically relating to **context-keyed relational coherence accumulation**, **doubly stochastic cross-context transfer**, and **bidirectional reflexive-deliberative processing**—are the subject of a pending United States Patent Application.

**Patent Number:** 63/988,438 (Provisional filed Feb 23, 2026)

### 1. Separation of Rights
The License provided in `LICENSE` is a **copyright license** only. It permits the copying, modification, and distribution of the source code under specific conditions. It **does not** grant any license, express or implied, to any patents owned by the Licensor.

### 2. The Bridge Period (2026–2032)
Until the **Change Date** (Feb 23, 2032), any commercial Production Use of the patented methods requires a separate, written Patent License Agreement.

### 3. Future Grant
Upon the Change Date, the Licensed Work will transition to Apache 2.0. At that time, the standard Apache 2.0 patent grant will apply to the version of the code as it exists on that date. The underlying patent remains in force beyond the Change Date. The Apache 2.0 patent grant covers use of this specific codebase only, not independent implementations of the patented methods.

### 4. Defensive Termination
Any patent license granted (or sought) shall terminate automatically if you commence patent litigation against the Licensor alleging that the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement.
